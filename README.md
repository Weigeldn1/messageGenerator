# Random Inspirational Message Generator

## Objective
Create a JavaScript-based application that generates a different inspirational message with each run. The message is formed by assembling three randomized components to ensure variability.

## Features
- **Pre-defined Arrays**: The script uses predefined arrays for the starting, middle, and ending segments of the message.
- **Random Selection**: A random number generator is employed to pick one element from each of these arrays.
- **Message Concatenation**: These elements are then concatenated to form a complete inspirational message.
- **Console Output**: The generated message is displayed in the console.

## Tech Stack
- **JavaScript**: Used for the main programming logic.
- **Node.js**: Enables the script to run locally.
- **Git**: Employed for version control.
- **Command Line**: Utilized for file management and Git operations.

## Milestones
1. **Initialize Git Repository**: Set up a new local repository for version control.
2. **Create JavaScript File**: Generate a JavaScript file that will contain the main logic of the message generator.
3. **Implement Logic**: Write the logic in JavaScript to randomize and assemble messages.
4. **Local Testing**: Run the program on your local machine to ensure its functionality.
5. **Commit to Git**: Make a final commit to your Git repository with the implemented code.
